This repository contains my personal notes on various frontend development topics. Inside the frontend folder, I have created multiple subfolders, each dedicated to a specific topic such as 
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and more. Every folder contains clear and concise notes that I have written while learning and practicing these concepts, along with examples and important points for quick understanding. 
The purpose of this repository is to keep my learning material well-organized in one place so that I can easily revise whenever needed and also share it with others who might find it helpful. 
Whether you are a beginner who is just starting to learn frontend development or someone revising concepts, these notes are structured in a simple way that makes them easy to follow. 
You can navigate through the folders, open the relevant topic, and read the notes to quickly refresh your understanding. Over time, I plan to keep adding more topics and improving the content to make it an
even better learning resource.
